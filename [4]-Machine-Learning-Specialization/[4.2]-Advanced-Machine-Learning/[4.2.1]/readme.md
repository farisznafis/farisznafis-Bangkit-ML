# [4.2.1] Neural Networks
This week, you'll learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks. You'll use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code. Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural network in Python, "from scratch". Optionally, you can learn more about how neural network computations are implemented efficiently using parallel processing (vectorization).

## Learning Objectives
- Get familiar with the diagram and components of a neural network
- Understand the concept of a "layer" in a neural network
- Understand how neural networks learn new features.
- Understand how activations are calculated at each layer.
- Learn how a neural network can perform classification on an image.
- Use a framework, TensorFlow, to build a neural network for classification of an image.
- Learn how data goes into and out of a neural network layer in TensorFlow
- Build a neural network in regular Python code (from scratch) to make predictions.
- (Optional): Learn how neural networks use parallel processing (vectorization) to make computations faster.
