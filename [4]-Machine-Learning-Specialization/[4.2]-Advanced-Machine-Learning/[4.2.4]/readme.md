# [4.2.4] Decision trees
This week, you'll learn about a practical and very commonly used learning algorithm the decision tree. You'll also learn about variations of the decision tree, including random forests and boosted trees (XGBoost).

## Learning Objectives
- See what a decision tree looks like and how it can be used to make predictions
- Learn how a decision tree learns from training data
- Learn the "impurity" metric "entropy" and how it's used when building a decision tree
- Learn how to use multiple trees, "tree ensembles" such as random forests and boosted trees
- Learn when to use decision trees or neural networks
