# [4.2.3] Advice for applying machine learning
This week you'll learn best practices for training and evaluating your learning algorithms to improve performance. This will cover a wide range of useful advice about the machine learning lifecycle, tuning your model, and also improving your training data.

## Learning Objectives
- Evaluate and then modify your learning algorithm or data to improve your model's performance
- Evaluate your learning algorithm using cross validation and test datasets.
- Diagnose bias and variance in your learning algorithm
- Use regularization to adjust bias and variance in your learning algorithm
- Identify a baseline level of performance for your learning algorithm
- Understand how bias and variance apply to neural networks
- Learn about the iterative loop of Machine Learning Development that's used to update and improve a machine learning model
- Learn to use error analysis to identify the types of errors that a learning algorithm is making
- Learn how to add more training data to improve your model, including data augmentation and data synthesis
- Use transfer learning to improve your model's performance.
- Learn to include fairness and ethics in your machine learning model development
- Measure precision and recall to work with skewed (imbalanced) datasets
