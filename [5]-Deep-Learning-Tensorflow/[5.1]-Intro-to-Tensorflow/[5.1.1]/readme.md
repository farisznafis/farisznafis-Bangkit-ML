# [5.1.1] A New Programming Paradigm
Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In Week 1, you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along. To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study...
