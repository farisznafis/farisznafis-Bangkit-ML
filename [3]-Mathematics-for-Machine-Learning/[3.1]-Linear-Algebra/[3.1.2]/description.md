# Solving system of linear equations
In this week, you will learn how to solve a system of linear equations using the elimination method and the row echelon form. You will also learn about an important property of a matrix: the rank. The concept of the rank of a matrix is useful in computer vision for compressing images.

## Learning Objectives
- Solve a system of linear equations using the elimination method.
- Use a matrix to represent a system of linear equations and solve it using matrix row reduction.
- Solve a system of linear equations by calculating the matrix in the row echelon form.
- Calculate the rank of a system of linear equations and use the rank to determine the number of solutions of the system.
