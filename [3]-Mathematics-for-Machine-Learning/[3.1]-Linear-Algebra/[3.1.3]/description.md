# Vectors and Linear Transformations
An individual instance (observation) of data is typically represented as a vector in machine learning. In this week, you will learn about properties and operations of vectors. You will also learn about linear transformations, matrix inverse, and one of the most important operations on matrices: the matrix multiplication. You will see how matrix multiplication naturally arises from composition of linear transformations. Finally, you will learn how to apply some of the properties of matrices and vectors that you have learned so far to neural networks.

## Learning Objectives
- Perform common operations on vectors like sum, difference, and dot product.
- Multiply matrices and vectors.
- Represent a system of linear equations as a linear transformation on a vector.
- Calculate the inverse of a matrix, if it exists.
