# Sampling and Point estimation
This week shifts its focus from probability and statistics. You will start by learning the concept of a sample and a population and two fundamental results from statistics that concern samples and population: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. In lesson 2, you will learn the first and the simplest method of estimation in statistics: point estimation. You will see how maximum likelihood estimation, the most common point estimation method, works and how it connects with regularization (technique used to reduce overfitting in machine learning) using Bayes theorem.
