# Derivatives and Optimization
After completing this course, you will be able to:

## Learning Objectives
- Perform gradient descent in neural networks with different activation and cost functions
- Visually interpret differentiation of different types of functions commonly used in machine learning
- Approximately optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using first-order (gradient descent) and second-order (Newtonâ€™s method) iterative methods
- Analytically optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using properties of derivatives and gradients.
